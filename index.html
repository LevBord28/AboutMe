        <h2> Let me explain a little bit about myself... </h2>
        <p> I am a 15 year old dude who is still experiencing with new stuff. Not really easy. I'm also into animation, video editing, and all that kind of crap. I also own a CD collection full of very cool music.
        <p> Funny enough, for the past few months, I've been watching more series and movies and it really inspires me to make either a movie or a series on my own! Isn't that cool?

        <h2> What are my current goals? </h2>
        <p> As of right now, my first goal is to make my animation team bigger and possibly get a studio to work more further and awesomer! My second goal is to possibly get a very very good amount of CDs to finish my CD collection. </p>
        <p> If none of these succeed, then.. oh well, I tried.
